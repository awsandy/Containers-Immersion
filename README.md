# Containers-Immersion

## Helper scripts for aws staff facilitating the workshop

The scripts `check-labXX.sh` will run some tests to check the participant has done the requested steps for each lab.

`lab0-setup.sh` - does all the setup and applies the root disk resize fix (see known issues below)

`labX.sh` - will build the repective X lab from the workshop and run the tests

`cleanup-all.sh` will take the participants environment back to the begining state of the lab.


-------

## The workshop default environment

OOTB the workshop provisions stack set: `containersid`

* VPC,subnets, routes, NatGW, an instance profile
* ECS Service, ECS TaskDefinition, Load balancer & target group
* ECR repo for mono & like (empty)
* dynamodb table and endpoint

Cloud9 IDE:  Project-containersid
ECS Cluster: Cluster-containersid
Task def:  Monolith-Definition-containersid:**1** (uses public nginx image)   
ECS Service: containersid-MythicalMonolithService-94G891MF0SXZ
ClouldWatch:  containersid-MythicalMonolithLogGroup-tN9a8V1mSrOA
ECR: containersid-like-8vloc4ntgy1t  (empty)
ECR: containersid-mono-cxdsl3ptepdt  (empty)

## Known issues with lab:

Without any actions you will run out of space just after lab 5 fix:

Either:

* run 00-setup/02-resize-osdisk.sh - will rezie root disk to 32GB (no reboot required)
* or just before you start lab 5 run `(docker images -q | xargs docker rmi || true) 2> /dev/null`

New version of task definition (Monolith-Definition-containersid:2)- pointing to monolth image above
Run the task - directly - (get it's public ip) - curl http://TASK_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS/mysfits
check cloud watch - then stop the task

---

## Lab03 - Use a service for the task definition

Update service to use the (Monolith-Definition-containersid:2) task definition

----

## Lab04 - like microservive

Edit mysfits.py - enable like route 
rebuild docker image  for monolyth (with new like route) - 
push mono image with "nolike" tag
also build the like image - and push to like registry
New task definition for mono (with nolike image)  (Monolith-Definition-containersid:3)
New take definition for like  (containersid-like-tN9a8V1mSrOA:1)
Update mono service - to use task defn (Monolith-Definition-containersid:3)
Create new service for like

# Lab05 - Build EKS Cluster

Install pre-reqs
Temp creds off
Launch cluster
Test cluster
[add console access]

# Lab06 - Install ALB and K8s console
ALB controller provision
K8s console 

---

## Lab07 deploy monolyth service
DynamoDB policy - for IRSA
Service Account
yaml for monolyth and deploy - includes service type LoadBalancer (port 80)
curl 
update index.html - use alb

----

## Lab08 like microservices, ingress to route
